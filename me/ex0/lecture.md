Figuring Shit Out



The Plan
========

* Try to figure out how C works
* I'll trying finishing this fucking course!



Linux Install
=====

On Debian/Ubuntu use:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential

On RedHat/CentOS:

    $ sudo yum groupinstall development-tools

I wonder how the up/down arrows work? 


I figured it out!!!
====
    Do you remember?
How did I do the above?



Linux Testing
=====

Test that your C compiler works with:

    $ cc --version



OSX Install
====

Install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), this will take a while.

Use XCode rich asshole!



OSX Testing
====

Test that your C compiler works with:

    $ cc --version




Windows Install
====

Install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

    or

[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)

    or

Use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to run Linux.

***trying to code with Windows***



Text Editors
=====

You should already have one.
Just don't use an IDE. They aren't very helpful.
